## Why?

React Native's Image size is rendered the same regardless of device screen size and screen resolution.
This component scales itself seemlesly on all iOS and Android devices.

## Installation

`npm install react-native-responsive-image --save`


## Usage


`<ResponsiveImage>` is expecting `initWidth` and `initHeight` props.

These values are used to set image size on any device that has screen size iPhone Plus, or larger.

Image is then scaled down for any smaller device.

For additional configuration you can pass the same props as for original [`<Image>`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image.html) component.



## Example

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import ResponsiveImage from 'react-native-responsive-image';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flexGrow: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'row' }}>
          <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
          <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
          <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('ResponsiveImageExample', () => App);
```


For `initWidth=138` it looks like this:

| Device               | Screen width | Scale | `<Image>` width |
|----------------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| iPhone SE            | 320          | 0.77  | 106           |
| iPhone X             | 375          | 0.902 | 117           |
| iPhone8 Plus         | 414          | 1     | 138           |
| Nokia 5              | 360          | 0.87  | 120           |
| iPad (or any tablet) | -            | 1     | 138           |


## Just one image?

It sounds like you could save some loading by delivering low resolution images to screens with lower resolution. The best way is to serve just one high-resolution (retina) well compressed image. Itâ€™s surprising how well they can be compressed, and the result looks the same.
